Steps to get Ubuntu VM installed on local step laptop:
1. Raise ITIS request under Approved Freeware Software with proper business justification.


Business justification example:
I am working on setting up POC for monitoring & automation. Need help to install WSL2 on my device

My Ticket ID for reference: RITM0024878

Note: Once ITIS team will install WSL2 on your system. By default it will install ubuntu VM on your local system.
It will ask for ubuntu user and password during installtion. Please provide user name and password as per your choice.
